Client suggestions and observations while using the driver app.
- Show where buses were at, and at what time.
- look at loo & stop
- have an hourly breakdown of how many people were picked up at what time
- keyboard doesn't go away easily
- double tapping the plus button zooms
- clicking the boarded number brings up keyboard
- baseball 1 and baseball 2
- normandy apartments
- autoselect the next stop
- Adding a form without a stop doesn't push after typing in numbers. it may have cleared the stop selection
- stops sending data
- maybe use a scroll down bar or dial button for amount of passengers
- seperate the loop to a different page (maybe have a change loop button?)
