- Really liked how easy loop creation was and ordering

- ### When editing entries it changes the number boarded back to 0

- ### They want bus # to be taken into account

- They are considering putting wifi on their busses because they would prefer live updating as opposed to pushing data at the end of the shift

  - if they do this, we need to switch back to pushing data after submiting

- pop up to verify if they want to push

- change "add" on driver app to "submit"

- in configure move driver, bus# and loop to configure

- add confirmation popup to end shift

- ### could we add something for going on break?

- Move driver, loop, stop, to the top

- ### Next meeting March 25 at 3:30

- ### make them enter in 0 before you can push any information

- ### add bus management to the dashboard

- bus#'s are 3 digits starting with 9

- put a log in buttonon configure that just takes them to the home page(stupid and we won't do)

- put configure into a modal/overlay (also not going to do. )

- ### change add to "send stop total"

- move the "add" button below the + and - signs to compensate for the keyboard hiding the submit button

- ### change "log out" to "new driver"
