# Bus Shuttle Log Collection System

The department of Transportation and Facilities Management wants to create a centralized system that will create and manage the logs created by shuttle-bus drivers on campus. These drivers currently write the data onto paper and then digitize this information on a computer at a later time. This new system should also represent the data to a supervisor in a useful way. 

### Project Description

Transportation and Facilities Management at Ball State wants to replace their old log collection system with a brand new computer-based system.

They were collecting information from each shuttles running around BSU (like how many people get on the bus at each stop etc.). They were utilizing a paper-based system that each driver has a paper to write the details at each stop. Then, each paper is computerized by someone at the end of the day.

They want to make this collection process centralized. They were to adopt a software to put at each bus with an appropriate device. Then, the collected information will be presented in a meaningful way.
