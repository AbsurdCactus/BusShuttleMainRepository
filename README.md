# Bus Shuttle Log Collection System

The department of Transportation and Facilities Management wants to create a centralized system that will create and manage the logs created by shuttle-bus drivers on campus. These drivers currently write the data onto paper and then digitize this information on a computer at a later time. This new system should also represent the data to a supervisor in a useful way.
